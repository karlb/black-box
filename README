--------------------------------< Black-Box >-----------------------------------

I'd like to receive a lot of comments and suggestions. You can get the newest 
version of Black-Box at:
    http://www.linux-games.com
and write a mail to:
    karlb@gmx.net

Controls:
    Mouse

To run this you need the SDL-library, if you don't have it get it from:
    http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/

--------------------------------< PARAMETER >-----------------------------------

"--nosound"                starts without sound
"--nofullscreen"           guess
"--levelnum [number]"      Starts with that level. The level number is shown
                          in the title bar.
